            <p>On April 28th, 2022, I (David) shared the following screenshot in a group chat full of guys I've known for over twenty years:</p>

            <p>I had been working through some of my coursework on Python/Flask, and when it came to the "compliment generator," I knew I had to go with some Homestar-based adjectives. You know, like, "punchable" and "technochocolatey." I stepped away for a bit, and when I came back, one of my friends, Sean, said, "Oooh, we need some Homestar Ipsum!" And after the conversation had percolated a bit, I thought, "...why don't I make this?"</p>
            <p>After some quick research, I found a <a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/creating-a-lorem-ipsum-generator-with-node-and-express-9e1af0b31c86">great tutorial</a> in building your own Lorem Ipsum generator and went to town. And while I did my best to make it my own, I freely admit I would not have come up with this on my own without the help. (Such is the life of coding, no?) However, I quickly realized the example Robert provided wouldn't work for me, as at the time of writing, I've only gone through 25 emails, and I'm at nearly 600 different possible sentences. While I'm sure there's an easier way to do this, I've simply been copying and pasting each email/toon into an array. So far, so good!</p>
            <p>That said, I recognize there are definitely going to be decisions made with this app that, if I was tackling something more "sacred," like the MCU or Star Wars, people would take offense to, such as where I might break up certain lines, or if I forget (or neglect) to use some of the extraneous dialogue. Part of this will be the result of me only doing a few at a time, so I'll forget what I did with emails prior. Because in full transparency, I am copying and pasting everything from the <a href="http://www.hrwiki.org/">HRWiki</a>, like I mentioned above, so if there is any fault, it's on me and me alone.</p>
            <p>In all seriousness, this project wouldn't even be possible without everyone who has invested their time and resources into the wiki. Y'all are saints. Also, a big thank you to Sean, Zach, Matt, and Frank for entertaining the idea and for the feedback. Crazy to think we've all known each other for almost thirty years and how Homestar has been a pivotal part of that friendship. And, of course, to the Brothers Chaps. Who knew those Flash cartoons back in the day would end up becoming what they did.</p>
            <p>Oh, and here's my obligatory <a href="https://github.com/dlmarshall3">Github plug</a>. Most of my work is done with a different account, where all of it is private, but I do have a few fun projects to check out. Largely Pokemon based, because my kids love those rascally critters.</p>
            <p>(And yes, I misspelled Stiny. Sue me. Or don't. Please don't.)</p>
